Lemme see here... Maybe I just need to use more of 'em?", "speakerName": "Sarisse", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Yeah, that makes sense.

Hiiii-ya!", "speakerName": "Sarisse", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Okay, that HAS to be enough. Now let's see if...", "speakerName": "Sarisse", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Nope. Nothing. Well, poo. I guess quantity doesn't have anything to do with it.", "speakerName": "Sarisse", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "So what other variables are there?", "speakerName": "Sarisse", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Hey, maybe there's a trick in the timing! If I can get the flash to go off right in front of Rathalos's beady little eyes, that will blind it for SURE!", "speakerName": "Sarisse", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "So next time I just... Huh?", "speakerName": "Sarisse", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Oh, for the love of clams! I used my entire supply of bombs!", "speakerName": "Sarisse", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "How the heck am I supposed to come up with a plan under these conditions?!", "speakerName": "Sarisse", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Okay, Sarisse.
