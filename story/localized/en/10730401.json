Please!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Er, if you consider the flow of mana to be 100 at ground level, the summit of a mountain would be something like 90?", "speakerName": "Midgardsormr", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Why do you know those numbers to such an exact degree?!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "We dragons are beings that co-exist with mana; we are acutely aware of even the smallest shift in its flow.", "speakerName": "Midgardsormr", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "In that case... Yes, this should work!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Was that a flash of inspiration?", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I have indeed—but it will require the assistance of Midgardsormr.", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "If he is willing to help, I should finally be able to calculate the edge of the sky!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"type": "break"}, {"content": "Are you willing to assist me in this, Midgardsormr? ...Pleeease?", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I must confess, you have awakened my interest in unpacking this mystery.", "speakerName": "Midgardsormr", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I have completed my investigation. If we consider the mana here to be 100, it is 99 at the top of the Halidom.", "speakerName": "Midgardsormr", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Hmm, I think we may need a more fine-grained number. What if we consider this place to be 1,000?", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "In that case, the Halidom would be 998.", "speakerName": "Midgardsormr", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Very good, thank you.

Give me a moment.", "speakerName": "Midgardsormr", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "The measure is—", "speakerName": "Midgardsormr", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Wait! Are you sure you went up exactly twice the Halidom's height? You didn't miss the mark in the slightest?", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "...Hmm. Now that you say that, I may have made a slight error.", "speakerName": "Midgardsormr", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "That is unacceptable. Precision is key when taking measurements such as this. Our entire endeavor hinges upon your exacting accuracy!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Now please be attentive to the flapping of your wings and fly to PRECISELY twice the height of the Halidom!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "You hold sway over the wind itself! Surely you can do this, yes?", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Very well. I shall provide you the answer— and accuracy—that you seek.", "speakerName": "Midgardsormr", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "This is starting to make my head hurt. How many of these measurements are you planning to do?", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "As many as it takes! We must fine-tune our measurements to an exacting degree until we discover exactly how the flow of mana changes at height.", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "This will allow us to calculate where the edge of the sky is located!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Give it your all, Midgardsormr! I'm counting on you!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "The amount of mana at twice the Halidom's height was 996.", "speakerName": "Midgardsormr", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "996, thank you. Next, I need a measurement at three times the Halidom's height.", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "In this fashion, Midgardsormr took to the skies time and again, until finally...", "speakerName": "SYS", "type": "conversation"}, {"type": "break"}, {"content": "Thank you, Midgardsormr. Now I should be able to make perfect calculations.", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Wow! At a height of more than 20 Halidoms, the reduction in mana shifts!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "So, taking all the data into account, the height where the mana reaches zero would be...", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Yes! 3,047 Halidoms worth of height! THAT is where the sky ends!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Whaat?! It's higher than 3,000 Halidoms?!", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Even I could not have imagined such a thing.", "speakerName": "Midgardsormr", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "The number really is unbelievable. Let me just double-check...", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "All right, I've re-run my calculations, and the number remains the same. The edge of the sky lies at a height of 3,047 Halidoms.", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Eureka! I've done it! I have pulled back the curtain on the edge of the sky through the power of numbers!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Though I suspect the number 3,047 Halidoms will hold little meaning for other people...", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "But it means something to ME, and that is what matters!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "It's a pretty spectacular outcome. Congratulations, Xiao Lei.", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Thank you! And thank YOU, Midgardsormr!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Ah! That gives me an idea! Would you allow me to ride on your back and visit the edge of the sky?!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I would love to be able to see the edge of the sky for myself!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "My apologies, but that is not possible. Not even I can reach such a height.", "speakerName": "Midgardsormr", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Oh. That's too bad.", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "...Wait! I've just had another spark of inspiration! I know what my next objective is going to be!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I will reach the edge of the sky and witness it in person, thereby proving it with both numbers AND practical observation!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "And how do you intend to do this when even the mightiest of dragons cannot?", "speakerName": "Midgardsormr", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I will...figure that part out later. But believe me, I WILL figure it out!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "After all, however unreasonable it may have appeared, we managed to unlock the secret of the sky's edge!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I've got a feeling you can solve any problem placed in front of you.", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Heh. Thanks. Oh, and I'll still be needing your help from here on out, if that's okay.", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Because someday we're going to see the edge of the sky together!", "speakerName": "Xiao Lei", "type": "conversation"}]}]
