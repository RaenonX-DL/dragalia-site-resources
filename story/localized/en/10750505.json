I have a younger sister I'm also unable to see right now, so I know how you feel.", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Really? We're two peas in a pod, then. Say... It's hard, huh? Not having your family there with you.", "speakerName": "Vania", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "You've got me, though, so buck up!

That's why I told you to hide behind me!", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "What? Why?! If you'd just work with me here, we'd be through with these chumps in two seconds!", "speakerName": "Vania", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "It's just the two of them!

Seize the vampire!", "speakerName": "Imperial Soldier", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Not today! Howl, my thunder!", "speakerName": "???", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Are you all right, Euden? The Knights of Levin will take this fight. I'll open a path for your retreat!", "speakerName": "Albert", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Albert?!

Why are you here?", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "You both left the Halidom in search of the seeds of the abyss.", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Indeed. Our probe revealed that Phares had given seeds to a number of soldiers as part of some experiment.", "speakerName": "Albert", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "We chased those rumors here, determined to put a stop to whatever he's planning.", "speakerName": "Albert", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "What?! You believe my brother is trying to use Vania and the seeds to some ill end?", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "We don't know the specifics any better than you, but he is all but certainly plotting something, and they're involved.", "speakerName": "Albert", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Hey, what are these ＂seeds of the abyss＂?", "speakerName": "Vania", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "An extremely dangerous breed of dragon. They are too great a force for mankind to wield. Should they try...this is the result.", "speakerName": "Yurius", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Ew, what IS that?! It's all wriggly and slimy and...EWWW!", "speakerName": "Vania", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "That is the price of said hubris. The seeds feed on human mana and fuse with it. They are a cursed thing.", "speakerName": "Yurius", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Now, a group of extremists within the Empire who hold the seeds seek vampire blood. The situation grows ever more grim.", "speakerName": "Albert", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "And Vania will continue to be a target until we stop them.", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Exactly. Which brings me to a proposal. Will you allow us to serve as her guards?", "speakerName": "Yurius", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Doing so would help us in our quest to destroy the seeds as well. A mutually beneficial arrangement for all parties.", "speakerName": "Yurius", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I agree. The information you've uncovered while tracking them will be vital to figuring out how the extremists knew about her.", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "But we've yet to hear the most important opinion on the matter. What say you, Vania?", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Fine by me.

The lightning magic guy is Sparky, and you, Mr. Unspeakable Tentacles man, you're Uncle Slimy.", "speakerName": "Vania", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Adjectives aside, I'm still not of an age fit to be anyone's... *ahem* It matters not. We need to formulate our plan.", "speakerName": "Albert", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Euden, let us pool our intel about the seeds and the trueblood to see if we can turn up a link between them.", "speakerName": "Albert", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "We still know little of vampires, let alone their higher echelon.", "speakerName": "Albert", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Of course. I'm no expert myself, but here's what I've gathered so far...", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "...He's just droning on and on.
