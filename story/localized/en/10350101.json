I'm not certain. Frankly, I expected someone with muscles. Possibly a beard.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Whatever. I'll allow you to hire me on.

Just because you're unaware of what a coup hiring me was doesn't change that.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "If you're asking for special treatment, I'm afraid I can't offer it—but rest assured everyone here is treated with respect.", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Fine, good enough.

That's some pretty impressive work ya been doin' lately.

Any other brilliant observations you'd like to offer?", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "＂Genius＂ is a convenient title, yeah? No proof required—just get to say it and off ya go.", "speakerName": "Ranzal", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Just what are you insinuating?! I think I've MORE than proven my genius here!", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "To yerself, sure—which gets ya as far as ＂self-professed genius.＂ But to be the real deal, ya gotta convince someone else.", "speakerName": "Ranzal", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "A genius is a genius. It's a statement of fact, not something that requires the say-so of another.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Well, ya got mine anyway, so that's a solid start on that next step.", "speakerName": "Ranzal", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "This is quite the turn from the local oaf. You DO acknowledge my genius, then?", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Got no reason to lie, do I?", "speakerName": "Ranzal", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Then put on more of a show of envying me. Stand in jealous awe of my intellect while cursing your own mediocrity!", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Bwa ha ha! Back when I was younger, I might'a done just that.", "speakerName": "Ranzal", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "But like I said, yer just barely at the first step here.", "speakerName": "Ranzal", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Ah, THERE we are! That had the faint ring of sour grapes. Delicious...", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I am bored to DEATH of praise. I want to see people writhe!", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Eh, it's easy enough to get respect, but givin' it? That's tricky.", "speakerName": "Ranzal", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Yer own talent and pride can get in the way and keep ya from seein' straight. Hell, yer a classic case of that.", "speakerName": "Ranzal", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Or perhaps no one else is at my level!

If there's no need for me to acknowledge anyone else as a peer, why would I ever do so?", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Sheesh. Got it all figured out, yeah? Ya MUST be a genius, then...", "speakerName": "Ranzal", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "At last, something we agree on!", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}]}, {"conversations": [{"content": "Yes? What is it? I can only assume you called me down here to lecture me.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Very good. Let's talk about how you comport yourself in combat.", "speakerName": "Cleo", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Some occasional grandstanding is benign enough, but your total lack of cooperation is a drain on everyone's morale.", "speakerName": "Cleo", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "So, what? I should hobble my genius to make nice with others?", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "This has nothing to do with your genius. I've collected the data. We can review it together once—", "speakerName": "Cleo", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Ugh, never MIND! I've heard it all before. This place is as hopeless as the others.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I'm fast arriving at the same conclusion about you. Perhaps it's time we all moved on.", "speakerName": "Cleo", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "What's that supposed to mean? Are you FIRING me?!", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Why would I need to? You won't stay.

Oh, you're a real piece of work, lady!", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I don't have to dig to hear rumors.", "speakerName": "Cleo", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "And you believed them blindly and decided to come needle me so I'd run off. That it?", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Oh, believe me, if I were trying to run you off, I wouldn't do so with needling. Ezelith, your talent is exceptional, but—", "speakerName": "Cleo", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "But what? I refuse to work beneath my full potential just to match pace with all the slack-jawed yokels around here?", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "BUT you have room to grow even further, is what I was going to say.

If I grew any further, there'd be no need for you at all!", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "And I would gladly welcome the time off.

About me.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Not a one of them complimentary.", "speakerName": "Cleo", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "And you believed them.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I believe in what I see with my own eyes— and what I see is budding talent.", "speakerName": "Cleo", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Budding... Fine, then! Gimme those tactics! I'll give 'em a thorough review!", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}]}, {"conversations": [{"content": "You mentioned before that you were curious to experience failure, Ezelith. Any luck so far?", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Of course not! ...But I think I at least have a better grasp of the concept now.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "What does failure mean to YOU, Euden?", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Hmm. I guess it's a feeling of frustration and impasse when all of your talent isn't enough to accomplish your goals.", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I'm well aware of the definition, thanks. I meant its PERSONAL significance.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "So, the lessons failure teaches a person?", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Exactly. You see, as a genius, I doubted I would ever truly know failure.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I've never cared a lick for the expectations of others, and any task I set my mind to can be accomplished with ease.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "That certainly sounds like a recipe for a failure-free life.", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Right? So the way I see it, the only way I can experience failure is through others.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Everyone around me screwed up and dragged me down, so I came up short— that sort of thing.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I...suppose that still qualifies as failure?", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "But getting over that would hardly help me grow. Honestly, I think this business about getting stronger with failure is malarkey.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "What's more, the people here are all reasonably smart and capable, so there's my last hope of failure out the window.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Anyway, that's when I started thinking of it differently. Like, what if what I did BEFORE finding this place was my stumbling block?", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I don't need to worry about future failures now. I can just stay here and be thankful for what I've found.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "That's actually a good way to think of it.", "speakerName": "Euden", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I KNOW, right? The ability to think outside the box like that is what defines a genius, you know.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}]}, {"conversations": [{"content": "We need to talk, old man.

It's not especially difficult, but... I can't do it alone.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Look at this diagram. The key lies in you and I tightly coordinating. I call this move ＂The Ranzelith Rampage.＂ Now, it's... Er...", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "What? Why are you grinning? Is it a creepy old man thing? Don't make me call Cleo!", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I'm just thinkin' back to when ya asked why ya'd ever wanna acknowledge anyone else—and look at ya now. I'm so proud!", "speakerName": "Ranzal", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Ew, don't get all nostalgic on me. That's SUCH an old man move.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Enough with the ＂old man＂ stuff already.

No.", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "What's wrong with—", "speakerName": "Ranzal", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "At the point I have to explain that, you are DEFINITELY an old man.

Then let's get practicing. If you manage to keep up with me, I might just accept you as my peer!", "speakerName": "Ezelith", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Whoa, slow down! Ya think the world's ready for Ranzal, genius of the century?", "speakerName": "Ranzal", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Ha! It's finally your time to shine!
