Logs?!", "speakerName": "Imperial Commander", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "AAAAAH!", "speakerName": "Imperial Soldiers", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "They're disoriented! Now's our chance!", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"type": "break"}, {"content": "Whew... We managed to drive them back.", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "But we've been hiding in this forest for five days now. I'm starting to get sick of eating fruits and berries.", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Stop complaining. Evading them would be trivial, but if we do that...", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "They'll turn their anger on the people of Hertz for defying them in the first place.", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Yes. Eventually, they will realize their continued pursuit here is only wasting resources.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "We need to hold out until then, and keep drawing them into this forest in the meantime. Now, prepare the next round of traps.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Yes, ma'am! Right away, ma'am!", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "What's got you so cheery? You didn't eat anything strange, did you?", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Heh. I just still can't believe you cast our mission aside to help those villagers.", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Yes... That may prove shortsighted. However...", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Wait, do you smell something burning?", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "They couldn't have...!", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"type": "break"}, {"content": "They're going to burn this whole forest down with us in it!", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "This is bad... We're surrounded by flames!", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "We have to be able to break through somewhere!", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "No dice—the flames are too strong! *cough* *cough*", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Blast... Is this really the end?", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Water magic?! Who did that?!", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Kirsty and Joachim, right? We've been searching high and low for you.", "speakerName": "Thaniel", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Who are you? You don't look like imperial soldiers...", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "We can make introductions later. For now, just know that we're here to help!", "speakerName": "Thaniel", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "We've secured an escape route. Follow us!", "speakerName": "Alain", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "What should we do, Commander?", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "We don't have time to press them on their identity.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "We'll just have to trust them. With me, Joachim!", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "You'll be safe here. There don't seem to be any imperials around.", "speakerName": "Alain", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Thank you both. We owe you our lives.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "If anything, you owe those brothers back in Hertz. They asked us to help the travelers who saved them.", "speakerName": "Thaniel", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "That was kind of them indeed—but if the imperial army thinks we got away, that whole village will be in danger.", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Fret not! They have all retreated to the Halidom's lands.", "speakerName": "Alain", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "With the soldiers caught up searching for you, we were able to lead the villagers to safety with ease.", "speakerName": "Thaniel", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "The Halidom? Then you must be with the prince Noelle mentioned in her report.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Indeed we are. Now, we should make a hasty retreat to the Halidom ourselves; this is still imperial territory.", "speakerName": "Alain", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "A party of this size would no doubt draw unwelcome attention. We're all wanted by the Empire at this point.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "We should part ways here.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Well... If you insist.", "speakerName": "Thaniel", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Wait! Before you leave, I have one question.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "You are enemies of the Empire, yes? Why did you take the risk of entering their territory?", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Oh, that's quite simple.", "speakerName": "Thaniel", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "The Halidom doesn't turn its back on people in danger. That's just how we are!", "speakerName": "Alain", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "...I see. That is admirable indeed.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"type": "break"}, {"content": "What should we do now, Commander?", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I think it's clear that an alliance with the Empire would not be in our country's best interests.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "If their army's leaders are as wretched as their soldiers, they would no doubt betray us in time. We should return home to report as much at once.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Agreed. A ＂breakdown in negotiations＂ sounds about right.", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Yes. And when we're inevitably sent back to open talks again, I intend to visit the Halidom on the way.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Oh? Why is that?", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "The king may insist on allying with such an openly evil power, but I won't stand by and watch our home march itself to ruin.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "However, this journey has taught me that I still lack the knowledge necessary to fight for what is just.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "And if Victor is to be believed, the best place to gain it may be at the Halidom.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I see.  ...Hm?", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "......", "speakerName": "???", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Ah, hello Noelle. Are you here with new orders from HQ?", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "N-no... Actually, I...", "speakerName": "Noelle", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "It's all right. Just give me the message.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "...What?!", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "What does it say?", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "It's...an invitation. The sender claims to be recruiting rebels to help cleanse our nation of the corruption that has taken root there.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "You can't mean...", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "A revolution, yes. Whoever wrote this says they only sent these invitations to those who ＂truly love our nation.＂", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "*nod* I-I gave one to Victor, too.", "speakerName": "Noelle", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Mm, and how did he respond?", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "He... He pretended not to care. But I think deep down, he really cares a lot!", "speakerName": "Noelle", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Hmm. Well, either way,  the timing is suspicious.", "speakerName": "Joachim", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Agreed. It's impossible to tell from this letter alone whether the sender is a well-intentioned patriot or simply hungry for the king's power.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "...But I have every intention of finding out.", "speakerName": "Kirsty", "type": "conversation"}]}]
