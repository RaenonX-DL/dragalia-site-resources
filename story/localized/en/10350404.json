Business not quite booming?", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "'S my regular face, thanks. And I get by just fine.", "speakerName": "Fried Bread Seller", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Funny you should say that. 'Cause from where I'm standing, you look like a guy who just lost a heretical grimoire and a big payday along with it.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Wha—?! Who the hell are you?", "speakerName": "Fried Bread Seller", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Me? Just a happy festival-goer. One who's absolutely rocking this yukata, I might add.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Funny how guys like you are much more open to chatting with someone in this outfit over, say, a set of inquisitor's robes.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Y-you're one of Ilia's dogs!", "speakerName": "Fried Bread Seller", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Woof woof. Funny thing about dogs— their teeth really have a way of sinking into flesh. And unfortunately for you, I seem to have forgotten my muzzle.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "D-damn it all!", "speakerName": "Fried Bread Seller", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Maybe my thinly veiled metaphor didn't make it clear enough: you're not going ANYWHERE, pal.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Gragh!", "speakerName": "Fried Bread Seller", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Listening comprehension isn't your strong suit, I see.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Tell you what.

That your bag?", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Yeah! Thank you, Curran. I'm so relieved.", "speakerName": "Lathna", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "But...how did you know it would be here?", "speakerName": "Lathna", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "The bag you were carrying had a copy of the Liber Grimortis in it, right?", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "You said it yourself: even if it's just a copy, it's important enough that you wouldn't go showing it off willy-nilly. With me so far?", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I think so.", "speakerName": "Lathna", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "What I'm saying is. I doubt the owner was carrying it around just for fun.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "A festival is probably the last place you'd want to bring something so illicit, right? That is, unless you had a reason.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "So you think they did it on purpose?", "speakerName": "Lathna", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Bingo. Every part of this was planned.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Odds are good the whole switcheroo with your purse while Melanie had it was intentional, too.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "But...why?", "speakerName": "Lathna", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "That's the kicker. They never meant to trade bags with HER.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Mr. Fried Buns was planning to make the swap for the Liber Grimortis with someone.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Not as an accident, but a deal.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Oh...", "speakerName": "Lathna", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "A guy sets his bag down real casual-like, and it gets swapped for an identical one. That's Illicit Trading 101.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "So because Melanie set my bag down while she was catching goldfish—", "speakerName": "Lathna", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Yup. It got mistaken for their client's. The perp took it and ran.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "No reason to stick around frying bread once the deal's done and dusted.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "So he closed up shop early and took off.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "And then he came back because...", "speakerName": "Lathna", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Because he took one look inside the bag and realized he'd botched the exchange.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Bet he was sweating bullets. No doubt he was expecting a tidy sum for a book that rare...", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "...but upon opening the bag, blammo. No gold. No jewels. No nothin'.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Wait, ＂jewels＂... Oh! Curran!", "speakerName": "Lathna", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Hm? What's up, kiddo?", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Look what's inside my purse.", "speakerName": "Lathna", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Why, what have you got in there? Ah, rock candy?", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "It's so sparkly—like jewels. I thought it was really pretty, so, um... I bought you some, Curran.", "speakerName": "Lathna", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "You sure you don't want to enjoy your pretty candy yourself?", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Positive. I thought it would be a small way of repaying you for always being so nice to me.", "speakerName": "Lathna", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I was so upset when I thought it was lost.", "speakerName": "Lathna", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Aha. So that's why you were so hung up on getting your specific bag back.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Boy, whoever said that thing about beauty only being skin deep must've been blind.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Your heart shines bright like a diamond, kiddo. You're a one-of-a-kind soul.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Hee hee. You got the line out without tripping over the words.", "speakerName": "Lathna", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Pfft. Let me tell you something, little lady.

Haven't seen your ugly mug in a minute. How's tricks?", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Blissfully quiet without your interjections. Would that I could always pursue my work so single-mindedly! Now, what is this I hear about your most recent caper, hm?", "speakerName": "Heinwald", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Something about you busting a ring of heretics at a summer festival? They say you single-handedly foiled a most dastardly scheme.", "speakerName": "Heinwald", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Yeah, well, ＂they＂ exaggerated. And?  Surely you didn't come all this way just to give me a friendly pat on the back.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "This same little bird told me you chanced upon a copy of the Liber Grimortis along the way. I don't suppose I could sweet-talk you into letting me have it...?", "speakerName": "Heinwald", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "You're talking about key evidence, pal. I can't just hand it out like a door prize.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Besides, I thought you already read the original Liber-whatsit. What do you want with some copy?", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Ah, but it is precisely BECAUSE it is a copy that I find myself so intrigued.", "speakerName": "Heinwald", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Some copies of the Liber Grimortis contain new theories not found in the original manuscript.", "speakerName": "Heinwald", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Some accounts say that reading the tome will awaken some untold horror. Others, that the text brings truth into relief with a certain mad clarity... A delicious thought.", "speakerName": "Heinwald", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Yum. I can almost taste the blasphemy. Well, you might be able to twist my arm. ...In exchange for intel on other heretics.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "What a peculiar proposition. Just what sort of information do you presume I possess?", "speakerName": "Heinwald", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Hah. I'm not blind, Heinwald. I know you were the original buyer for the grimoire that day.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I also know you were the one who hired Dominic and the thugs who tried to nab Lathna's bag.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "My, my... Quite the fanciful theory. I would be curious to know what sort of foundation you're basing these allegations upon.", "speakerName": "Heinwald", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "This mysterious employer sent two— count 'em, two—grown men to snatch a purse from Lathna.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Most folks wouldn't waste good coin hiring muscle to shake down a defenseless girl. You'd just do it yourself.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "There are plenty of people in this world with reputations to uphold. Perhaps they preferred to keep their hands clean?", "speakerName": "Heinwald", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Then they'd hire a single thug. This employer opted for two.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Because he knew that if they made one wrong move, that ＂little girl＂ would become a real big problem.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "What's more, these thugs knew her. Name, face, the whole shebang.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "So we have someone with an interest in grimoires, no misgivings about dealing with heretics, and familiarity with Lathna.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Narrows the list down to about...one, no?", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "A truly breathtaking display of conjecture. You would suspect me on such flimsy grounds?", "speakerName": "Heinwald", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "You want proof, try this one on for size: the fact that you're here says everything.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "...What?", "speakerName": "Heinwald", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I haven't told a soul that I found a copy of the Liber Grimortis in that bag.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "So, tell me about this ＂little bird＂ of yours. And don't try to say it was Lathna.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Hm. I am mortified to have overlooked such a glaring detail. But very well. You win this round.", "speakerName": "Heinwald", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "—Is what I would say if I were a witless dove caught in the birdlime of your puerile reasoning. I was obviously aware, Curran.", "speakerName": "Heinwald", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Wait, what? Now I'M confused.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "I wanted to ask your assistance with those very heretics, which is why I've given up on the tome and approached you directly.", "speakerName": "Heinwald", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "That's...odd. Must be quite the case if you're willingly coming to me.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Yes, I suppose it is. Well? What say you, partner? If you're enticed, then let's be off.", "speakerName": "Heinwald", "type": "conversation"}, {"content": "Heh. Wouldn't miss it for the world, partner.", "speakerName": "Curran", "type": "conversation"}]}]
